# MachineLearningFinalProject
This project analyzes data collected on six individuals wearing a personal tracking device.
The project preprocesses 159 covariates and trains a machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the outcome of a weightlifting exercise based on a subset of the covariates using a Random Forest model and PCA data preprocessing.
The data is sourced from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
The R code produces a series of charts, code and explanations illustrating the process of 
covariate selection and model construction.
